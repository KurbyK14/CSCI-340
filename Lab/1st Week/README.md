### This is a getting more experience coding lab on STL Vectors

If you want, you can complete the following tasks to gain more experience with STL vectors, using the starter code and Makefile provided.

1) add 10 natural numbers which are multiples of 10 eg: 10,20,....100.
2) Print the vector.
3) add 5 to each elements of the vector.
4) print vector again in reverse order using a reverse iterator
5) modify vector again by adding a random number between 0 and 99 to each element
6) print vector again
7) using STL sort the vector using mySortFunction for comparison
8) print the vector again adding ""(" << *i%8 << ")"" to show how items are sorted, `i` is an iterator
